// Example
// Remember that accurate and concise naming is key for your functions. You should be able to tell what the function is supposed to do based off its name alone.

// Q1. If we input the number of pizzas we have, return the number of slices you would have if each pizza could be split into 8 slices.
var pizzaSlices = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = 'hello world';
  return myOutputValue;
};

// Q2. Fahrenheit to Celsius
var fahrenheitToCelcius = function (input) {
  var myOutputValue = 'hello world';
  return myOutputValue;
};
